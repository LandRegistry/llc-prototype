# Local Land Charges Prototypes
## Migrated July 2023

This repo is an updated version of the previous [LLC prototype](https://github.com/LandRegistry/local-land-charges-prototypes), migrated to v13 of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

The main aim is to test revisions to the existing Beta service.


## Running this app

This repo is a copy of GOV.UK Prototype Kit version 13

[Version 13](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/whats-new) is a significant change from previous versions


- node 18 is needed
- run 'npm init' to install node modules
- use 'npm run dev' NOT 'npm start' to run the kit locally
- template / layout locations in the app have changed



## Notes

This prototype uses [default json data](https://github.com/LandRegistry/llc-prototype/blob/main/app/views/how-to/server-side-data.md) for local land charges. It also has an [example of conditional logic](https://github.com/LandRegistry/llc-prototype/blob/main/app/views/how-to/includes.md) with `includes` files


## About the Prototype Kit

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.
