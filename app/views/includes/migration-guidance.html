<p>We have updated the local land charges when we added them to this service, where there was missing or incorrect information.</p>
<p>This means there will be some differences to what was previously held by the local authority.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="../results-page/results-guidance" target="_blank">local land charge notes for Liverpool City Council (opens in new tab)</a> to see what information has been updated.<p>
